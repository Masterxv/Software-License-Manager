Software License Manager(SLM) is a platform designed for software distributors.
The platform gives you the oppurtunity to secure your sofware from being pirated, that doesn't mean it cannot get pirated.
The platform is built for easy usage with a nice UI. You can look at analytics of software activations and more.
